# Predicting Biodegradability of Molecules through QSAR Analysis

This project utilizes machine learning to predict molecular biodegradability through Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis. Our models classify chemical compounds as biodegradable or non-biodegradable based on molecular descriptors.

For detailed methodology, results, and conclusions, please refer to the comprehensive [project report](ec_group23_report.pdf).
